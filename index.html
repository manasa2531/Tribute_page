                     <p>Between May of 2000 and June of 2023, There are many freedom fighters or people who have done many things to nation, society. But there will be some secret agents whom we wont recognize, they can be our friends,family,our most dear once. There will be many things we just judge people just by looking at them if its there bad time we come to a conclution that they are bad! As we are common people, we would'nt be recognised by someone unless someone takes an initiative. 
                        But now i want to take this inititative! My very close friend or a sister is one of my secret agent where i want her to be recognised.</p>

               <h2>Biography</h2>
               <p>I know her since May of 2022, we have just a one year of friendship but i can proudly say we have maintained a very strong bond. we use to understand each other gave TIME to eachother when we feel low! In my perceptive TIME plays a major role in a human life, If you feel close with someone give them TIME dont make them feel alone at any cost! Because the next second things may change there will be noo use when if we realise later NOTE IT!</p>
               <p>We have done many things together in a very short period of time and gathered many wonderful memories, there's a small incident which i want to share, In the month of april, its a sunday and we thought of going to kailashgiri, visakahpatnam, India. we have met 10 in the morning and together going to complex to board the rtc bus to kailashgiri. we went, we have enjoyed but while returning we went to complex again we are just crossing the road to board a auto to go home.
                   while crossing the road we have save an accident there are two people father and a 5 year old girl child, the accident was at very corner that no one have recognized them and were in there own busy and duties. we were already late it is 7pm in the night and within 30 minutes we have to be going to home. But the father is fully injured and doughter is seriosly fighting with her death, she thought of saving her we went to them we called an ambulance she is with the father of the small child, 
                   and i am taking care of child, the child have no mother she have passsed after her doughter was born they have no relatives instead they all have left as the childs parents got love marriage. in the hospital its almost 9pm and they have said it costs 10k for recovery we both have kept all our savings there are many calls which we have went through as its an accident but they both have saved! its been 10:30pm after reaching home we have got to lots of scolding but even though they did not effect us as we are very happy for what we have done, without sister i wont experience these experience saving the lives of strangers and i am seriously thankful for these experiences there a many more she did but thus is one of it. 
                   if i alone be at such situation i would obviously think what alone could i do.</p>
                   <p>she thought of helping the poor ,donate food in temples i will make sure to take the resposibility to fulfill all your dreams until i exist, spreading happiness to everyone even she's suffering inside, its very hard to be like her she use hide her own emotions for making everyone happy!</p>
               <p>she have been with me on my disgusting and hard days, she use to support me in everything and understand me, the most important part is she believed me i will always keep her trust safe.</p>
               <p>i always love you and will be loving you, i miss my best partner.</p>
